prd.md — Future You 
1. App Overview & Objectives 
Future You is a gentle web-based experience designed to help users reconnect with their inner 
strength and self-trust. The app addresses the problem that users often feel disconnected from 
their future selves, leading to anxiety, indecision, or lack of confidence in life. 
Objectives: 
 Make the user feel emotionally anchored and capable in any situation. 
 Provide a short, meaningful interaction that evokes courage and self-trust. 
 Offer a simple, reflective daily prompt without creating pressure or obligations. 
 Maintain a clean, gentle, text-focused interface that is intuitive and emotionally safe. 
2. Target Audience 
Role / Context: 
 Individuals experiencing anxiety, overwhelm, or feeling stuck in life. 
 Users seeking brief emotional grounding rather than productivity or task tracking. 
Skill Level: 
 Comfortable with basic web apps. Not power users. 
Constraints: 
 Limited attention and emotional energy; interactions must be short, intuitive, and 
frictionless. 
 Emotional tone must be safe, supportive, and non-judgmental.

5. Data & Logic 
Inputs:

 Templates for generated messages 
Processing: 
 Personalize message using inputs 
 Save minimal user state for future visits 
 No historical analysis, streaks, or social sharing 
Outputs: 
 Rendered text only 
 Light persistence of user responses 
Assumptions: 
 Emotional resonance is prioritized over accuracy or detail 
 One strong interaction is more valuable than multiple weak interactions 
 Generic-but-personalized content is acceptable for demo 
6. Security Considerations 
 Minimal personal data stored (email, optional name, inputs). 
 User data stored securely with basic encryption. 
 No external sharing by default. 
 Light persistence only; consider auto-deletion or anonymization after demo period. 
7. Potential Challenges & Solutions 
Challenge 
Solution 
Users disengage if setup is too long Keep description + time horizon input short (2–4 sentences, 3 
fields max) 
Emotional tone feels fake or 
judgmental 
Daily interaction becomes 
burdensome 
Use inner voice style: clear, kind, non-directive 
One short, optional reflection question per visit; allow skipping 
Technical errors in generating letter Provide fallback generic letter, neutral retry messages 
8. Future Expansion Possibilities 
 Multi-session guidance or journaling flow 
 Optional personalization via AI to make letters dynamically richer 
 Light visualization (calm graphics) to reinforce emotional impact 
 Integration with mobile notifications for daily reflection 
 Longer-term habit or goal tracking if product expands beyond demo 
Emotional Core (Summary) 
 Primary feelings: strength / courage and self-trust / freedom 
 Tone: The user’s own inner voice, clearer and kinder 
 Session length: 3–5 minutes 
 Use pattern: Optional daily or occasional check-in 
Tagline (conceptual): 
“Meet your future self. Feel their courage. Trust yourself today.”
